      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Ride It Out ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") is a mobile application designed to help users
        build tolerance for discomfort through acceptance-based techniques. This Privacy Policy explains
        how we handle your information when you use the App.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy applies to all users of the Ride It Out iOS application.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Ride It Out is designed with privacy at its core.</strong> We collect as little data as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Data stored on your device only</h3>
      <p>The following data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Session history (duration, type, completion status)</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Session count for free-tier tracking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not require you to create an account. We do not collect your name, email address, phone number,
        or any other personal identifying information.
      </p>

      <h3>Data we do NOT collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal information (name, email, phone)</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No health data</li>
        <li>No contacts or photos</li>
        <li>No browsing history</li>
        <li>No device identifiers for tracking purposes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>RevenueCat</h3>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat</a>
        to manage in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat processes purchase transactions through the Apple App Store
        and may receive anonymized purchase data. RevenueCat does not receive your personal information from us.
        Please refer to RevenueCat's privacy policy for details on their data practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Apple App Store</h3>
      <p>
        Purchases are processed by Apple. Apple's handling of your payment information is governed by
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- Analytics placeholder: Add analytics service privacy details here when implemented.
           Example services: Mixpanel, PostHog, or similar.

      <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
      <p>
        All app data is stored locally on your device. Sensitive data (such as subscription status) is stored
        using encrypted on-device storage. <strong>We do not operate servers that store your data.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you delete the App, all locally stored data is permanently deleted. There is no cloud backup
        or account recovery — your data exists only on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your Rights — California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California
        Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) provide you with specific rights regarding your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your personal information. Since all data is stored on your device, you can delete it at any time by deleting the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.</li>

      <p>
        If you are a Canadian resident, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act
        (PIPEDA) provides you with rights regarding your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you. Since data is stored only on your device, you already have full access.</li>
