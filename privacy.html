      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Ride It Out ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") is a mobile application designed to help users
        build tolerance for discomfort through acceptance-based techniques. This Privacy Policy explains
        how we handle your information when you use the App.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy applies to all users of the Ride It Out iOS application.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Ride It Out is designed with privacy at its core.</strong> We collect as little data as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Data stored on your device only</h3>
      <p>The following data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Session history (duration, type, completion status)</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Session count for free-tier tracking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not require you to create an account. We do not collect your name, email address, phone number,
        or any other personal identifying information.
      </p>

      <h3>Data we do NOT collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal information (name, email, phone)</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No health data</li>
        <li>No contacts or photos</li>
        <li>No browsing history</li>
        <li>No personal identifiers — analytics use a pseudonymous ID not linked to your name, email, or device</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>RevenueCat</h3>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat</a>
        to manage in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat processes purchase transactions through the Apple App Store
        and may receive anonymized purchase data. RevenueCat does not receive your personal information from us.
        Please refer to RevenueCat's privacy policy for details on their data practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Apple App Store</h3>
      <p>
        Purchases are processed by Apple. Apple's handling of your payment information is governed by
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Mixpanel (Analytics)</h3>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixpanel</a>
        to understand how features are used so we can improve the App. Mixpanel receives usage events
        (such as sessions started and completed, features viewed, and settings changes), along with
        general properties like app version and whether you have a premium subscription.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mixpanel identifies you using a pseudonymous user ID generated by RevenueCat. This ID is not
        linked to your name, email address, or any other personal information. We do not send personal
        data to Mixpanel.
      </p>

      <h3>Sentry (Crash Reporting)</h3>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentry</a>
        to detect and fix app crashes and errors. Sentry receives crash reports, error details,
        and basic device and operating system metadata. Sentry is enabled in production builds only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sentry identifies you using the same pseudonymous RevenueCat user ID described above.
        No personal information is sent to Sentry.
      </p>

      <h3>Cross-App Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        We do not use Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), do not track you across other apps
        or websites, and do not participate in cross-app advertising or data sharing.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
      <p>
        All app data (session history, preferences, settings) is stored locally on your device. Sensitive
        data (such as subscription status) is stored using encrypted on-device storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third-party services described above (RevenueCat, Mixpanel, and Sentry) store data on their
        own infrastructure. This data is limited to what is described in each service's section above and
        does not include personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytics and crash data are retained by third-party services in accordance with their respective
        privacy policies. If you delete the App, all locally stored data is permanently deleted. There is
        no cloud backup or account recovery for local data.
      </p>
