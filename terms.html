      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using Ride It Out ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        Ride It Out is a mobile application that provides tools for building tolerance to discomfort
        through acceptance-based techniques. The App includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feel It:</strong> A timed session with a minimal interface designed for sitting with discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Breathe It:</strong> A breathing pacer with guided breathing patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Face It:</strong> Acceptance-based messages for moments of acute distress.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The App is a self-help tool. It is not a medical device, therapy program, or clinical intervention.
      </p>
